#Welcome to Limbo!

Limbo is a lost-and-found inventory system for [Marist College](http://www.marist.edu), created using [PHP](http://php.net), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), and the [Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com). This web application is the result of a group project for a Computer Science course at Marist, Software Development II.

Using Limbo, a user can report lost or found items, or claim a found item as theirs. An admin (with their separate admin pages) can modify the database, create and supervise other admin accounts, and perform other maintenance on the site.
